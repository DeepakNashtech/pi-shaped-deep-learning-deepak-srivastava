## Core Concept Questions & Answers

### 1. What is the role of feature scaling/normalization in training neural networks?

Feature scaling/normalization is crucial for neural networks because:

- **Prevents feature dominance**: Features with larger scales (e.g., age vs. income) won't dominate the learning process
- **Faster convergence**: Gradient descent converges much faster when features are on similar scales
- **Numerical stability**: Prevents gradient explosion/vanishing problems
- **Equal weight initialization**: All features start with equal importance in the model
- **Activation function efficiency**: Functions like sigmoid and tanh work better with normalized inputs

In our project, we used `StandardScaler` which transforms features to have mean=0 and standard deviation=1.

### 2. Why do we split data into training and testing sets?

Data splitting serves several critical purposes:

- **Unbiased evaluation**: Test set provides honest assessment of model performance on unseen data
- **Overfitting detection**: Large gap between train/test performance indicates overfitting
- **Model selection**: Compare different models fairly using the same test set
- **Generalization assessment**: Ensures model will work well on new, real-world data
- **Prevent data leakage**: Model never sees test data during training

We used an 80/20 split with stratification to maintain class balance in both sets.

### 3. What is the purpose of activation functions like ReLU or Sigmoid?

Activation functions introduce non-linearity and serve specific purposes:

**ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**:
- **Non-linearity**: Enables learning complex patterns (without it, network would be just linear regression)
- **Computational efficiency**: Simple max(0, x) operation
- **Mitigates vanishing gradient**: Gradients don't shrink in positive region
- **Sparse activation**: Many neurons output 0, creating sparse representations

**Sigmoid**:
- **Probability output**: Maps any input to (0,1) range, perfect for binary classification
- **Smooth gradient**: Differentiable everywhere
- **Historical significance**: One of the first activation functions used

**Why we need them**: Without activation functions, stacking multiple layers would be equivalent to a single linear transformation, limiting the model's learning capacity.

### 4. Why is binary cross-entropy commonly used as a loss function for classification?

Binary cross-entropy is ideal for binary classification because:

- **Probability interpretation**: Works naturally with sigmoid outputs (0-1 probabilities)
- **Penalizes wrong predictions**: Loss increases exponentially as predicted probability moves away from true label
- **Smooth gradients**: Provides stable gradients for backpropagation
- **Maximum likelihood**: Mathematically equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation
- **Well-behaved**: Convex function that's easy to optimize

**Formula**: `L = -[y*log(p) + (1-y)*log(1-p)]`
Where y is true label (0 or 1) and p is predicted probability.

### 5. How does the optimizer (e.g., Adam) affect training compared to plain gradient descent?

**Adam optimizer advantages over plain gradient descent**:

- **Adaptive learning rates**: Different learning rates for each parameter
- **Momentum**: Uses moving averages of gradients to smooth updates
- **Bias correction**: Corrects initialization bias in moving averages
- **Faster convergence**: Typically reaches good solutions faster
- **Better handling of sparse gradients**: Works well with sparse data
- **Less hyperparameter tuning**: Often works well with default settings

**Plain gradient descent limitations**:
- Fixed learning rate for all parameters
- Can get stuck in local minima
- Slow convergence on ill-conditioned problems
- Sensitive to learning rate choice

### 6. What does the confusion matrix tell you beyond just accuracy?

The confusion matrix provides detailed insights:

**Beyond accuracy, it reveals**:
- **True/False Positives & Negatives**: Exact counts of each prediction type
- **Class-specific performance**: How well the model performs on each class
- **Error types**: Whether model tends to have false positives or false negatives
- **Precision & Recall calculation**: Can derive these metrics from the matrix
- **Class imbalance effects**: Shows if model is biased toward majority class

**In medical diagnosis**:
- False Negatives (missing cancer) are typically more serious than False Positives
- The matrix helps assess if the model is appropriately conservative

### 7. How can increasing the number of hidden layers or neurons impact model performance?

**More layers/neurons can**:

**Positive impacts**:
- **Increased capacity**: Can learn more complex patterns
- **Better feature extraction**: Deep networks learn hierarchical features
- **Higher accuracy**: May improve performance on complex datasets

**Negative impacts**:
- **Overfitting**: Model memorizes training data instead of learning patterns
- **Vanishing gradients**: Gradients become too small in early layers
- **Computational cost**: More parameters mean slower training/inference
- **Diminishing returns**: Performance may plateau or decline

**Best practices**:
- Start simple and gradually increase complexity
- Use regularization (dropout, L1/L2) to prevent overfitting
- Monitor validation performance to find optimal size

### 8. What are some signs that your model is overfitting the training data?

**Key overfitting indicators**:

- **Performance gap**: High training accuracy but low validation/test accuracy
- **Loss divergence**: Training loss decreases while validation loss increases
- **Perfect training scores**: 100% training accuracy is often a red flag
- **High variance**: Model performance varies significantly with small data changes
- **Complex decision boundaries**: Overly intricate patterns that don't generalize
- **Sensitivity to noise**: Small input changes cause large output changes

**In our project, we used**:
- Validation split to monitor overfitting
- Dropout layers for regularization
- Early stopping to prevent overtraining

### 9. Why do we evaluate using precision, recall, and F1-score instead of accuracy alone?

**Limitations of accuracy**:
- **Class imbalance**: High accuracy possible by always predicting majority class
- **Context ignorance**: Doesn't account for cost of different error types
- **Misleading**: Can be high even when model fails on important minority class

**Additional metrics provide**:

**Precision**: "Of positive predictions, how many were correct?"
- Important when false positives are costly
- In medicine: Avoids unnecessary anxiety/procedures

**Recall**: "Of actual positives, how many did we find?"
- Important when false negatives are costly
- In medicine: Ensures we don't miss cancer cases

**F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- Balances both concerns
- Good single metric when both precision and recall matter

**In cancer detection**: High recall is crucial (don't miss cancer), but precision also matters (avoid unnecessary worry).

### 10. How would you improve the model if it performs poorly on the test set?

**Systematic improvement approach**:

**1. Diagnose the problem**:
- Check for overfitting (train vs. test performance gap)
- Analyze confusion matrix for error patterns
- Examine learning curves

**2. Data-related improvements**:
- Collect more training data
- Improve data quality (remove outliers, fix labels)
- Feature engineering (create new features, remove irrelevant ones)
- Data augmentation techniques

**3. Model architecture changes**:

- Try different activation functions
- Experiment with different architectures (CNN, RNN for appropriate data)

**4. Regularization techniques**:
- Add dropout layers
- Use L1/L2 regularization
- Implement batch normalization
- Early stopping

**5. Hyperparameter tuning**:
- Learning rate optimization
- Batch size adjustment
- Optimizer selection (Adam, RMSprop, etc.)
- Grid search or random search

**6. Advanced techniques**:
- Ensemble methods (combine multiple models)
- Transfer learning (use pre-trained models)
- Cross-validation for more robust evaluation

**7. Domain-specific approaches**:
- Consult domain experts
- Apply domain knowledge to feature selection
- Use appropriate evaluation metrics for the problem
